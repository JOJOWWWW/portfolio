              <h1>About Me</h1>
              <p>
                Hello! I'm Jojo B. Bandayrel, a working student who does his<br />
                activities and work at the same time. And when I'm not working<br />
                on my sideline, you'll most likely find me playing games.<br />
                Whether it's a casual session or a deep dive into a competitive<br />
                match, gaming is my way of unwinding and keeping things<br />
                exciting.<br />
              </p>

              <p>
                In my free time, I enjoy immersing myself in different game<br />
                worlds, challenging myself, and sometimes even picking up new<br />
                skills along the way.<br />
              </p>

              <p>
                As for my future, I see myself working in an office setting,<br />
                either in a corporate role or serving in the military in an<br />
                administrative position. Structure and discipline appeal to me,<br />
                but I also know how to keep things lighthearted.<br />
              </p>

              <p>
                Some might call me crazy or silly, but I believe that a little<br />
                bit of humor makes life more enjoyable.<br />
              </p>

              <p>
                One quote that I live by is: "Patience is the key to success."<br />
                No matter the challenge, I remind myself that perseverance and<br />
                patience will always lead to growth and achievement.<br />
              </p>
